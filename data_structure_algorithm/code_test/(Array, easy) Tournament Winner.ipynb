    "There's an algorithms tournament taking place in which teams of programmers compete against each other to solve algorithmic problems as fast as possible.<br>\r\n",
    "Teams compete in a round robin, where each team faces off against all other teams.<br>\r\n",
    "Only two teams compete against each other at a time, and for each competition, one team is designated the home team, while the other team is the away team.<br>\r\n",
    "In each competition there's always one winner and one loser; there are no ties.<br>\r\n",
    "A team receives 3 points if it wins and 0 points if it loses.<br>\r\n",
    "The winner of the tournament is the team that receives the most amount of points.<br>\r\n",

    "Given an array of pairs representing the teams that have competed against each other,<br>\r\n",
    "and an array containing the results of each competition,<br>\r\n",
    "write a function that returns the winner of the tournament.<br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "The input arrays are named competitions and results, respectively.<br>\r\n",
    "The competitions array has elements in the form of [homeTeam, awayTeam], where each team is a string of at most 30 characters representing the name of the team.<br>\r\n",
    "The results array contains information about the winner of each corresponding competition in the competitions array.<br>\r\n",
    "Specifically, results[i] denotes the winner of competitions[i], where a 1 in the results array means that the home team in the corresponding competition won and a 0 means that the away team won.<br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "It's guaranteed that exactly one team will win the tournament and that each team will compete against all other teams exactly once.<br>\r\n",
