    "Only one query can be executed at a time, but the queries can be executed in any order.\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "A query's waiting time is defined as the amount of time that it must wait before its execution starts.<br>\r\n",
    "In other words, if a query is executed second, then its waiting time is the duration of the first query;<br>\r\n",
    "if a query is executed third, then its waiting time is the sum of the durations of the first two queries.<br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "Write a function that returns the minimum amount of total waiting time for all of the queries.<br>\r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "For example, if you're given the queries of durations [1, 4, 5], then the total waiting time if the queries were executed in the order of [5, 1, 4] would be (0) + (5) + (5 + 1) = 11.<br>\r\n",
    "* The first query of duration 5 would be executed immediately, so its waiting time would be 0,\r\n",
    "* the second query of duration 1 would have to wait 5 seconds (the duration of the first query) to be executed,\r\n",
    "* and the last query would have to wait the duration of the first two queries before being executed.\r\n",
