    "# Definition\n",
    "A **singly linked list** is a collection of **nodes** that collectively form a linear sequence. Each node stores\n",
    "* a reference to an object that is an element of the sequence; and\n",
    "* a reference to the next node of the list\n",
    "\n",
    "The first node is named **head**, and in some applications, the last node of the list is named **tail**.\n",
    "* We can identify the tail as the node having `None` as its next reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of tracking throught the list is commonly known as **traversing** the linked list. Because the next reference of a node can be viewed as a **link** or **pointer** to another node, the process of traversing a list is also known as **link hopping** or **pointer hopping**.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important property oflinked list is that it **does not have a predetermined fixed size**. It uses space proportionally to its current number of elements."

    "### Pros\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linked Lists have **constant-time insertions and deletions** in any position, in comparison, arrays require O(n) time to do the same thing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Linked lists can continue to expand without having to specify their size ahead of time\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "* To **access an element** in a linked list, you need to take O(k) time to go from the head of the list to the kth element. In contrast, arrays have constant time operations to access elements in an array."
